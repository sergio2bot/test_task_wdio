## Repository description

This is the test task implementation. 
For implementation I was using Page Object pattern. 
Test framework is written with `Cucumber` and `webdriverIO`.
Ci has been added - `Github actions`

Current version of the project is done only as a test task and can be run only in Chrome. It is possible to run it with other browsers, but you will need to install packages by yourself.

After each execution Cucumber Html report is generated automatically. 
`reports` folder contains example of the report

**Steps**

  Command is looking like - `npm run wdio`
